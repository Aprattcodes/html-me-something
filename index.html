    <h1>Bakeneko</h1>
    <p class="header-p">The bakeneko (化け猫, "changed cat") is a type of Japanese yōkai, or supernatural creature. There are legends of bakeneko in various 
        parts of Japan, but the tale of the Nabeshima Bakeneko Disturbance in Saga Prefecture is especially famous.</p>

                <h2>Origin</h2>
                <p> The reason that cats are seen as yōkai in Japanese mythology is attributed to many of their characteristics: 
                    for example, the irises of their eyes change shape depending on the time of day, their fur can seem to cause sparks when 
                    they are petted (due to static electricity), they sometimes lick blood, they can walk without making a sound, their wild 
                    nature that remains despite the gentleness they can show, they are difficult to control (unlike dogs), their sharp claws 
                    and teeth, nocturnal habits, and their speed and agility.Many other animals appear as yōkai in old tales and display 
                    similar attributes: the deep tenacity of snakes, the ability of foxes (kitsune) to shapeshift into women. However, 
                    cats figure in a great number of tales and superstitions because they live with humans yet retain their wild essence 
                    and air of mystery.

                    One folk belief about the bakeneko is that they lick lamp oil. In the Edo period encyclopedia Wakan Sansai Zue, 
                    it is said that a cat licking this oil is an omen of an impending strange event. People in the early modern period 
                    used cheap fish oils in lamps, e.g. sardine oil; that could explain cats wanting to lick them. Also, at that time the 
                    Japanese diet was based on grains and vegetables, and while the leftovers were fed to the cats, as carnivores, 
                    the cats would have lacked for protein and fat and therefore been even more attracted to lamp oils. Moreover, the 
                    sight of a cat standing on its hind legs to reach a lamp, its face lit with anticipation, could have seemed eerie and 
                    unnatural, like a yōkai.

                <h2>Folk legends</h2>
                    <p>There are tales of cats that became bakeneko after being raised for twelve years. In Yamagata District, 
                        Hiroshima Prefecture, it is said that a cat raised for seven years or longer will kill the one that raised it. 
                        There are also many regions where, due to this superstition, people decided in advance for how many years they would 
                        raise a cat.Depending on the area, there are stories in which cats that were brutally killed by humans would become 
                        bakeneko and curse that human. Bakeneko stories are not only about aged cats, but also sometimes about revenge against
                        cruel humans.The abilities attributed to bakeneko are various, including shapeshifting into humans and wearing a 
                        towel or napkin on the head and dancing.

                <img class="article-img" src="images\neko.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                The popular good luck totem, the Maneki-neko (招き猫, "Beckoning Cat") found in shop fronts, is also a type of bakeneko.
                Cats that were caught drinking lamp oil were also considered to be bakeneko. Cats may have regularly drunk lamp oil because it was derived from fish oil. 
                The stealing of household objects is commonly associated with many Japanese ghosts, and thus the disappearance of lamp oil when a 
                cat was present helped to associate the cat with the supernatural.
